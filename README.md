A lightweight graph-based database system written with Clojure.

## Description

mesh is being developed as a hobby project. It strives to allow for the storage and search of graphs. Development began on December 1 2018. 

# CLI

## Usage

### Example

<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danjrauch/mesh/master/images/example1.png">

### Insert

Begin by creating a graph.
```sh
mesh=> create ^name
```

You can create nodes for your graph.
```sh
mesh=> create (^name:^descriptor:... {^attribute-name:^attribute-value ...}) (...)
```

You can also create undirected and directed edges for your graph.
```sh
mesh=> create (^name)-[^label]-(^name)
```
or
```sh
mesh=> create (^name)<-[^label]-(^name)
```
or
```sh
mesh=> create (^name)-[^label]->(^name)
```
depending on if you want an undirected or directed edge.

### Load

Find and load a graph into memory.
```sh
mesh=> load ^name
```

### Display 

You can list the graphs in the database.
```sh
mesh=> list
```

You can display nodes on the screen.
```sh
mesh=> show (^name)
```

# Persistent Graphs

# In-memory Graphs

### Docker

mesh is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container. In the directory with the Dockerfile run:
```sh
docker build .
docker run -ti --name mesh -v $(pwd):/mesh <dockerID from build output>
```
Then afterwards just run:
```sh
docker start -i mesh
```
to restart the container.
