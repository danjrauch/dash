A lightweight graph-based database system written with Clojure.

## Description

dash is being developed as a hobby project. It strives to allow for the storage and search of entities and relationships through a tableless architecture. 
In other words entities and relationships are first class types. It supports a cypher-like, derivative query language. Development began on December 1 2018.
