### Insert

Begin by creating a graph.
```sh
mesh=> create ^name
```

Create nodes for your graph.
```sh
mesh=> create (^name:^descriptor:... {^attribute-name:^attribute-value ...}) (...)
```

Create undirected and directed edges for your graph.
```sh
mesh=> create (^name)-[^label]-(^name)
```
or
```sh
mesh=> create (^name)<[^label]-(^name)
```
or
```sh
mesh=> create (^name)-[^label]>(^name)
```
depending on if you want an undirected or directed edge.

### Load

Find and load a graph into memory.
```sh
mesh=> load ^name
```

### Display 

List the graphs in the database.
```sh
mesh=> list
```

Display nodes on the screen.
```sh
mesh=> show (^name)
```

### Save

Save your current graph to the graph.fress file.
```sh
mesh=> save
```

# Persistent Graphs



# In-memory Graphs

### Docker

mesh is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container. In the directory with the Dockerfile run:
```sh
docker build .
docker run -ti --name mesh -v $(pwd):/mesh <dockerID from build output>
```
Then afterwards just run:
```sh
docker start -i mesh
```
to restart the container.
