### Docker

dash is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container. In the directory with the Dockerfile run:
```sh
docker build .
docker run -ti --name dash -v $(pwd):/dash <dockerID from build output>
```
Then afterwards just run:
```sh
docker start -i dash
```
to restart the container.

## Usage

Begin by creating a graph.
```sh
create name
```

Find and load a graph into memory.
```sh
load graph name
```

You can create nodes for your graph.
```sh
create (name:descriptor:... {attribute name:attribute value ...}) (...)
```

You can also create undirected and directed edges for your graph.
```sh
create (name)-[label]-(name)
```
or
```sh
create (name)<-[label]-(name)
```
or
```sh
create (name)-[label]->(name)
```
